Simple static methods to be called at the start of your own methods to verify correct arguments and state. This allows constructs such as

     if (count <= 0) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("must be positive: " + count);
     }
to be replaced with the more compact
     checkArgument(count > 0, "must be positive: %s", count);
